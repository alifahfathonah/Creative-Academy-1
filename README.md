# Creative-Academy
 The "Creative Academy" is a web-based project that will help IT students take classes in IT
courses of their choice online. Students can learn about IT courses from home from this
platform. In addition, this system will play an important role in the global epidemic of Covid-19
among students. My system will help students to take IT courses of their choice, watch course
videos, read blog posts related to the course, and check the problem. Read the necessary
documents and above all the course teacher will provide all kinds of support to them. In
Bangladesh, this system will only help IT, students to play a major role in acquiring IT course
knowledge.
